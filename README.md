## 📖 Project Overview

NexLink is a full-stack URL shortening and analytics platform built with React, TypeScript, Express, and MongoDB. Users can create short links, track click analytics, generate QR codes, import/export CSV data, and manage links through a responsive dashboard. The backend is a JWT-authenticated REST API; the frontend is a file-routed React SPA. Every redirect is handled server-side with sequential security checks (expiry → click limit → password gate) before issuing a `302` and recording a visit.

---

## 🎯 Demo Highlights

- Create and manage shortened URLs
- Track click analytics in real-time
- Generate and download QR codes
- Import and export URLs using CSV
- Secure links with passwords, expiry dates, and click limits
- View browser, device, and traffic analytics

## 📋 AI Planning Document

### Requirement Analysis
Core requirements were identified: URL shortening with analytics, QR code generation, CSV import/export, and JWT-based authentication with email verification and password reset.

### Architecture Planning
A decoupled client-server architecture was chosen. The React SPA communicates with the Express API over JWT-authenticated HTTP. TanStack Router handles file-based, JWT-guarded routing; TanStack Query manages all API state.

### Database Design
Three MongoDB collections were designed: `users` for authentication and preferences, `urls` for link metadata, and `visits` for per-redirect analytics records.

### Development Workflow
Backend controllers were built first (auth → URLs → analytics), then frontend pages were wired up. Email flows were added last with a console fallback so the app works without SMTP configured.

## 🗄️ Database Overview

**User** — Stores authentication credentials, email verification state, password reset tokens, and workspace preferences.

**URL** — Stores the original destination, generated short code or custom alias, expiry date, click limit, optional password hash, tags, and favorite/archive flags.

**Visit** — Stores a per-redirect record of IP address, browser, device, country, referrer, and UTM parameters for analytics.

AI assistance was used during planning, architecture design, component generation, debugging, and documentation. All generated code was reviewed, tested, and modified before integration into the final application.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- MongoDB running locally on `127.0.0.1:27017` (or a remote Atlas URI)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gowsicMS45/katomaran-url-shortener-Nexlink.git
cd katomaran-url-shortener-Nexlink
```

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in values
npm run dev            # starts on http://localhost:5000
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev            # starts on http://localhost:5173
```

> **Email codes in development**: Without SMTP configured, verification and reset codes are printed to the backend console — search for `[VERIFICATION CODE LOG]` and `[PASSWORD RESET LOG]`.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### Backend — Railway
1. Connect the GitHub repo → set **Root Directory** to `backend`.
2. Add all `backend/.env` variables; set `NODE_ENV=production` and point `MONGODB_URI` to Atlas.
3. Deploy — Railway exposes a public HTTPS URL.

### Frontend — Vercel
1. Import the repo → set **Framework** to `Vite`, **Root Directory** to `frontend`.
2. Update `API_BASE_URL` in `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` to the Railway backend URL.
3. Add a `vercel.json` for SPA routing:
   ```json
   { "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }] }
   ```
4. Deploy.

---

## 📝 Assumptions Made

1. **API URL is hardcoded** — `http://localhost:5000/api` in `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` must be updated before production deployment.
2. **Country data is approximate** — country is derived from the IP's last octet modulo 6, not a real GeoIP database.
3. **Email is optional** — if SMTP vars are absent, codes are printed to the server console; all features still work.
4. **Rate limiter is in-memory** — resets on server restart; not suitable for multi-instance deployments without Redis.
5. **No credential required for local MongoDB** — update the URI for any auth-protected or Atlas instance.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. No pagination for large datasets.
2. Country analytics currently use approximate location mapping.
3. Email verification is not enforced before login.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

1. Replace hardcoded API URL with a Vite environment variable (`VITE_API_URL`).
2. Add server-side pagination to the link list endpoint.
3. Integrate a real GeoIP database (e.g. `geoip-lite` or MaxMind).
4. Replace the in-memory rate limiter with a Redis-backed store for horizontal scaling.
5. Enforce email verification before allowing link creation.
